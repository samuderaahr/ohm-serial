# OpenHardwareMonitor to Serial

This is a personal fork of OHM that aims to bridge the readings of various OHM sensor with external microcontroller via COM/Serial Port. I use this for controlling external PWM fans, LCD display of temperatures, and RGB lights on my under-desk "desk-bottom" PC.

Sensor access provided by OpenHardwareMonitor Library: https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor
Cancelled using fancy gauges as it will affect performance, using text labels instead. Probably next time around.
